# filter-testssl
## filter, sort and format findings generated by testssl.sh

[testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/) is a very useful tool to assess the
configuration of TLS servers. It also produces very pretty output and even
supports JSON and CSV if you want to process scan results programatically.

`filter-testssl` parses the CSV generated by `testssl.sh` and allows you to
filter, sort and format the findings of a scan. Right now this project is very
much an early prototype and does not provide many user-controlled options.

### Usage

    testssl.sh --log --csv https://rc4.badssl.com/
    ./fltssl.py *.csv
